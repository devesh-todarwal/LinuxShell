following:
- A prompt should be displayed upon starting the execution of a program and
it should allow the user to type basic commands one after the other. The
program must support at least any 6 commands such as ls, cd, mkdir,
rmdir, rm, cp, mv, etc.
- For each of the userâ€™s commands entered, a separate child process should be
created to execute the command and display the output if any.
Note: Execution should be terminated only when the user types the command exit
on prompt.
